**Outline**

* Examine the mean and standard deviation of LDL cholesterol across cohorts by: 
  + 1. Plot mean and SD for each cohort.
  + 2. Perform Kruskal-Wallis test to compare means across cohort.
  + 3. Examine SNP-exposure association plots for each ancestry. 
  + 4. Examine Q-Q plots for each ancestry.

Read in relevant packages 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
```

Read in LDLc data 
```{r}
dat <- read.table("C:/Users/ac14629/OneDrive - University of Bristol/MRC_cross_population_network/LDL_analysis/GLGC_LDLc_mean_SD_cohorts.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
head(dat)
```
**Plot mean and SD for each cohort**

```{r, echo=FALSE,results='hide',fig.keep='all'}
p <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = Cohort, y = mean_ldl)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_ldl-mean_ldl_SD, ymax = mean_ldl+mean_ldl_SD))
  theme_minimal()
p
```

**Compare difference in means using Kruskal-Wallis test**
```{r}
res_kw <- kruskal.test(mean_ldl~Cohort, data = dat)
print(res_kw)
```
Evidence suggests no difference in mean between cohorts (P > 0.05)

**SNP-exposure association plots**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/ac14629/OneDrive - University of Bristol/MRC_cross_population_network/GLGC/per_ancestry_snp_ldlc_regression.png")
```

SNP-exposure association across ancestries look consistent with all slopes around 1 and intercepts only slightly above 0.

**Q-Q plots per ancestry** 

AFR
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}

```

EAS
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width="50%"}

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/ac14629/OneDrive - University of Bristol/MRC_cross_population_network/GLGC/glgc_eur_qq.png")
```

HIS
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/ac14629/OneDrive - University of Bristol/MRC_cross_population_network/GLGC/glgc_his_qq.png")
```

SAS 
```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/ac14629/OneDrive - University of Bristol/MRC_cross_population_network/GLGC/glgc_sas_qq.png")
```

Across ancestries, shape of Q-Q plot curve looks similar and slopes look consistent.
