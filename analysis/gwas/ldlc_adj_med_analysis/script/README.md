# Adjusting observed LDL cholesterol values by medication status 

## Background 
In individuals taking LDL-lowering medication, their observed LDL cholesterol (LDLc) values will appear to be lower when truly these values would be high. Therefore, to restore their LDLc values to approximately their true values we perform relative and absolute medication adjustment 

## Simulation 
```

```

## Organise data 
Relative medication adjustment 
```

```
Absolute medication adjustment 
```

```

## Conduct GWAS 
```

```

## LD clump GWAS to identify number of independent SNPs 
```
